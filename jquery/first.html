        <p>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal
            and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across
            a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way
            that millions of people write JavaScript.
